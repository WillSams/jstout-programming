# JStout's NES Programming Notes

***WIP*** Starting to jump back into this fall of 2021, I'll update this repo as I get a grapple on this again.  In the winter, will work on replacing the current sprites with new assets generated by [NES Screen Tool][2].

Just putting [jstout's notes][1] here, excellent set of notes. 

## Building the Demos

I use the assembler/linker provided by the [cc65 compiler][3] and [FCEUX][6] for debugging.  Install both on Debian-based distros (or, on Windows via WSL) by simply executing:

```bash
sudo apt install cc65 fceux
```

Each demo will have to be compiled individually.  Just execute `make` within the directory of the demo's corresponding make file.

## Editing

Not a requirement, but the code editor I use is [Visual Studio Code][4] with the Cole Campbell's [language support extension][5].  To install Visual Studio Code (again, on Debian-based distros or Windows WSL), execute:

```bash
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install code
echo -e "export DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
